# AoC 2025 solutions (C++)

Brute forcing everything for the dub!! Why use brain _(dumb)_ when you can use CPU _(smart)_ instead?

**Note to self:** USE UINT64 FOR EVERYTHING!! THIS IS NOT PYTHON!!

## How to run

1. drop the input into `input.txt` in the same directory as the solution `.cpp` file
1. run the `.cpp` file
1. voilà

## Disclaimer

Code is bad. AoC is what I do when procrastinating and sleepy. Perhaps it would be less putrid to look at a more organized repository. Helpful [GitHub Search Link](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code+2025+lang%3AC%2B%2B&type=repositories) for doing so.
